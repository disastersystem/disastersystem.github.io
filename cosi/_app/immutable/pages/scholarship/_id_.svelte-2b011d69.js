                                    Applicants wishing to apply to Eiffel scholarship must first contact the Consortium and send a short CV and available transcripts of first years of bachelor's programme. The academic coordinator will then (usually within 5 business-day) notify to the applicant if her/his application has been short-listed and will be sent for consideration to Campus France directly by the University Jean Monnet. Note that considering the very high level of selection, the academic coordinator may decided that the applicant have a profile good enough to be selected to the COSI programme and other associated scholarships but not quite good enough for the Eiffel scholarship.

This evaluation test will be the final written exam of the course module Introduction to MatLab, considering that acquisition or validation of this core competence is crucial in determining student future success. Details regarding course content and performance assessment criteria (including previous intake exams) are available on the Programme's website and on the course module syllabus. If, after having been given a chance to re-sit, the student's performance is still far below the consortium's minimal performance requirements, the scholarship offer will be withdrawn.
