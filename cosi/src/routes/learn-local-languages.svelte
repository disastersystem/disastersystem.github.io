                Although 100% taught in English, our Master Degree Programmes are designed to offer a truly European experience to our students which means that we also encourage the students to spice up their language skills with introductory language courses in French, Spanish, Finnish or Norwegian. This is a way to increase your employability and allow you to get most of your student's life in hosting campuses.
