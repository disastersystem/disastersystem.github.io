                Guidelines to add your COSI degree to your LinkedIn profile
            </h2>
            <p class="cosi-p">
                To contribute to raising the international profile of your COSI Master Degree, it is important that, as an alumni, you follow those guidelines to increase the visibility of your Master degree through LinkedIn. We believe also that it is crucial that alumni acknowledged correctly the Higher Education Institutions that have worked toward delivering a high-value Master Degree. This will ultimately help you in your career path by adding value to your academic background.
