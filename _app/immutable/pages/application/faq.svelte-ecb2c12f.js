                    No. Your online application to COSI degrees will be used to award scholarships managed by the Consortium as well
                    (Erasmus+ EMJMD scholarships, Consortium scholarships, Foundation Jean Monnet scholarships), and,
                    if you're selected, to national scholarships programmes during the period of study. Scholarships
                    attribution will be communicated at the same time as the outcome of the selection. Time will be given
                    to applicants to confirm / choose between degrees in the light of the scholarship award.

We encourage you to look for such opportunities, that can complement the financial support you'll may received from us. We'll provide any needed supporting documentation but application to such programmes are your own responsibility. Application process and supporting documentation differs between programmes.

                    Erasmus+ EMJMD, is a very generous scholarship that can virtually finance any expenses (including
                    costs of living and travel expenses) during your 2-years Master's Degree enrollment. Consortium scholarships
                    reduce considerably the Participation Costs. Other programmes are available to scientific students with
                    outstanding academic background. Please do apply; you'll be informed of scholarship award at the same
                    time as the selection outcome and given time to decide if you wish to enroll given the level of financial
